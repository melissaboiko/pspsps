pspsps(1) is a compyuter software to call an online catgirl nya.

pspsps(1) is nice and tries to guess the best options for you~ ฅ^•ﻌ•^ฅ    
for most ppl u can just call `pspsps` n it will work! probably (｡•̀ᴗ~)-✧

u can control colours, backnyends n stuff.    
call it with -h, the options should be self-explanyative.

if it looks wrong try with less colours!    
the more columns and lines in your terminyal, the better the drawings
will look.

catgirls are kindly provided by Safebooru.    
u can call other peoples too with `--tags`. like

there are optinyons to make them smaller or bigger or save the images
or load from an image and meowre!

u can also make drawings with nyascii characters nyanstead of
colourful nyansi art.  tho the mangas in nyascii dont look so good in
most terminyal sizes, mew.  but on the linux kyonsole (with few
colours & no Nyunicode but good resolution) a girl thinks ascii looks
better nyoften.
