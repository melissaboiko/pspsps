pspsps is nice and tries to guess the best options for you~ ฅ^•ﻌ•^ฅ
for most ppl u can just call `pspsps` n it will work! I hope (｡•̀ᴗ~)-✧

u can control colours backnyends n stuff.
call it with -h, the options should be self-explanyative.

if it looks wrong try with less colours!
the more columns and lines in your terminyal, the better the drawings
will look.

catgirls are kindly provided by Safebooru.
u can call other peoples too with `--tags`. like

there are optinyons to make them smaller or bigger or save the images
or load from an image and much meowre!

art. tho nyascii doesnt look so good in most terminyal sizes, mew.
